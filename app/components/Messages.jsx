            Setting your height to 100% in a div only means that your div will fill 100% of its container; not 100% of the page.
            I would suggest that you would either want to use a min-height declaration on your div or its container or use JavaScript
            to find the initial height of the user's screen (because everybody will have something slightly different) and set that as
            an inline style on your div.
